# Momentum-Trading-Strategy
A momentum strategy uses the principle that the past results (min 12 months) will predict future returns. Our approach is longing the past winners and shorting the past losers. Our momentum strategy has produced high returns and a strong alpha correlated to the market. However, momentum crashes, as seen by the “peaks” in the graph below, occur right after a market crash, during the recovery phase especially when the market continues to experience high volatility. During the period of market downturn, firms that performed the best are low beta. However as the market begins to recover, stocks in the short portfolio, with high betas, effectively rebound more significantly than firms in the winner portfolio. The shorting results in a significant loss, over, that which our long positions can offset. Our portfolio effectively loses money due to the incorrect position it takes on the previous year’s winners and losers. Hence in periods of market recovery, an alternative would be for our momentum strategy to long high- beta stocks and short low-beta stocks. Although there are fluctuations in the returns, our overall performance is pretty strong. It does not result in a loss below that of our initial investment, whilst nearly doubling our returns, over the 4 year time period during which we initiated the strategy. As a result our recommendation would be to invest in this strategy.
