# Momentum-Trading-Strategy
A momentum strategy uses the principle that the past results (min 12 months) will predict future returns. This approach is longing the past winners and shorting the past losers. The momentum strategy employed here has produced high returns and a strong alpha correlated to the market. However, momentum crashes occur right after a market crash during the recovery phase especially when the market continues to experience high volatility. During the period of market downturn, firms that performed the best are low beta. However as the market begins to recover, stocks in the short portfolio, with high betas, effectively rebound more significantly than firms in the winner portfolio. The shorting results in a significant loss, above that which its long positions can offset. The portfolio effectively loses money due to the incorrect position it takes on the previous yearâ€™s winners and losers. This strategy though, does not result in a loss below our initial investment. t nearly doubles our returns, over the 4 year time period during which we initiated it.
